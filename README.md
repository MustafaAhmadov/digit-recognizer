# **Digit Recognizer**

This is a simple project that demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The web-based interface lets users draw digits on a canvas and see real-time predictions.

## **Live Demo**
üåê Try it here: [Digit Recognizer](https://MustafaAhmadov.github.io/digit-recognizer/canvas.html)

---

## **Features**
- Draw digits (0‚Äì9) on an interactive canvas.
- Get real-time predictions powered by a trained CNN model.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.
